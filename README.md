<p>We had 5 member in our group, but because of some issue they are not able to contribute in this project and we have only 3 member to accomplish this with in a sort period of time. This the first project where we use react as frontend framework. We had faced a lot of issues in cloning the website and going through many documentation we find the solution. We also gets so many syntax error every day, for this purpose we had two meeting session everyday where we all share our problems with each other to find solution. By this we all get idea about how much work is left and how much time we needs to give for completing the project.</p>
